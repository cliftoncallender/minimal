This analysis focuses on the voice-leading and harmonic constraints underlying many of the chord progressions in Ligeti's fifth Piano Etude, which the composers describes as "almost a jazz piece." Ligeti's harmonic approach in this etude seems less systmatic than many of his other works, but extending Neo-Riemannian approaches to efficient motions between tertian harmonies of indefinite size reveals the basic principles at work and the multiple laments implicit in the texture.
