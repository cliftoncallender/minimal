[Recent][Quinn1] [work][Quinn2] by [Ian Quinn][Quinn] investigates the harmonic quality of pitch-class sets through the use of the discrete Fourier transform. This paper uses the continuous Fourier transform to extend Quinn's work to continuous pitch and pitch-class sets, demonstrate distance measures in continuous Fourier spaces that correlate strongly with existing interval-based similarity measures, and gives a sample of how these continuous spaces can be used to investigate the structural properties underlying the Z-relation (the latter based on [joint work][z-handout] with [Rachel Hall][Hall]).
