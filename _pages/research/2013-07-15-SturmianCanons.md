Investigation into the structural properties of rhythmic canons based on Sturmian words. These Sturmian canons are aperiodic, hierarchical, and potentially self-similar rhythmic patterns that give rise to aperiodic (thus infinite) rhythmic canons, tilings, and polyrhythms. (Left-side of the above image is taken from [Hanna Uscka-Wehlou][Wehlou]'s work on [digital lines of irrational slope][Wehlou1], which has a natural interpretation in terms of rhythmic canons. My own work teases out these implications and extends her results to hierarchical periodicities manifest in terms of canonic structure.)
