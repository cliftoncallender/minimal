[Infinite Canons][InfiniteCanons] is an ongoing series of canons with infinite solutions. More specifically, each canon is based on a melodic line that can be combined in any number of voices, in any tempo ratios (rational or irrational), and with each voice moving either forward or backward through the line, while maintain harmonic consistency. You can read an [in-depth description][InfiniteCanons] or listen to [Canonic Offerings](/composition), an original composition based on a limited set of these combinations.
