Recent work on Ligeti's use of complementary collections in his late works, which [Richard Steinitz](http://www.hud.ac.uk/research/researchcentres/cerenem/emeritusprofrichardsteinitz/) refers to as "Combinatorial Tonality," presented at the [2017 Conference on Mathematics and Computation in Music](http://www.mcm2017.org/). (An earlier version presented at the [2017 Joint Mathematics Meeting of the American Mathematical Society and Mathematical Association of America](http://jointmathematicsmeetings.org/jmm).) These works exploit the intervallic content both _within_ and _between_ collections. The intra- and inter-harmonic potentials are analytically useful and exhibit nice mathematical properties. Analysis of Ligeti's Désordre develops ideas in [Lawrence Quinnett](http://www.lawrencequinnett.com/)'s FSU doctoral treatise [_Harmony and Counterpoint in Ligeti Études_](http://diginole.lib.fsu.edu/islandora/object/fsu:185306/datastream/PDF/view).
