This is a recent presentation at the [2017 Joint Mathematics Meeting of the American Mathematical Society and Mathematical Association of America](http://jointmathematicsmeetings.org/jmm) on Ligeti's use of complementary collections in his late works, which [Richard Steinitz](http://www.hud.ac.uk/research/researchcentres/cerenem/emeritusprofrichardsteinitz/) refers to as "Combinatorial Tonality." These works exploit the intervallic content both _within_ and _between_ collections. The intra- and inter-harmonic potentials are analytically useful and exhibit nice mathematical properties.
