These are just of few recent examples of research projects and compositional approaches that rely on computational methods for manipulating, analyzing, and generating musical data. The goal of this course is to explore these methods by developing music programming and computational skills and applying these tools in projects of primary interest to students.

To that end, the first part of the seminar will focus on music programming in Python and Music21. [Python][python] is a general-purpose, object-oriented, interpreted programming language that emphasizes clear, readable code, is relatively easy to learn, and has support in the academic community with extensive outside libraries. For musicians, [Music21][music21] is a particularly useful set of Python tools "for helping scholars and other active listeners answer questions about music quickly and simply." (For more details, read Dmitri Tymoczko's [review of Music21][review] in _Music Theory Online_.)

The second part of the course will be driven by student interest and individual or group projects. Research projects may include corpus studies, analysis of expressive performance data, probabilistic models of musical similarity, etc. Compositional projects may involve algorithmic or computer-assisted composition, live coding, or real-time performer/computer interaction.

While previous programming experience is helpful, it is not required. (Students without previous programming experience are strongly encouraged to go through the free [Python tutorials][Python tutorials] on [Codecademy][codecademy] prior to the start of the course.) The seminar is intended for graduate students in music theory and composition, musicology, and ethnomusicology. Others interested in taking or auditing the course are encouraged to contact me.
