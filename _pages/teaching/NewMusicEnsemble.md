### Notes

_acdc_ is based on a simple, almost pop, chord progression that somehow found its way into 11/8, the basic time signature that runs throughout the whole piece. I layered oddly phrased melodies on top, with the cello playing a pizzacato bass groove. _acdc_ was commissioned by the Alternate Currents ensemble, which made me think about electricity. I’m not a scientist or engineer, so I was free to imagine that alternating currents were something like two different speeds or rhythms going on simultaneously.

_If It’s Not Baroque_ makes to the old joke, “if it’s not Baroque, don’t fix it.” While this piece is not completely Baroque-n, it does pay homage to some of my favorite composers of the Baroque era. The first movement draws from the concerti of Vivaldi. The “Air” finds its inspiration in the highly ornamented keyboard works of Couperin, as well as referencing the French Baroque practice of uneven notes (notes inégales), and J.S. Bach’s beautiful counterpoint was the primary inspiration for the last movement.

_The Yellow Pages_  
If one believes that appropriation is not a viable aesthetic, then one must conclude that shopping in the pawnshop of tonality will yield musical pages that are yellowed and old. Yet if one believes in the possibility of ahistoricism and further is not bothered by notions of accessibility and the 'allographic', then the music could be compared to the yellow pages, published for AT&T, as that book finds a place in every home. And paging through the categories of telephone numbers inside, one notices that, alphabetically, they change slowly: 'Automobile Wrecking', 'Aviation Consultants', and 'Awnings and Canopies'. This gradual transition is reflected in the handling of a slow transpositional process in the piece. Finally, the key of G Major, around which the piece is based, is the color of yellow, or at least a darkish burnt yellow.

_Pulau Dewata_, whose title means “Island of the Gods” in Indonesian, is a tribute piece to the wonderful Balinese people. The whole piece is merely a melody whose rhythmic language is sometimes drawn from the Balinese rhythmic line. A tribute with memories of this island. The ending of the piece is in fact an exact quotation of the “panjit prana,” the offering dance of the Legong. I wanted a simple piece: monochrome, a short piece above all full of joy, alternating single melodies—“intervalized”—and complementary melodies in the Balinese style. It is a child’s music ...
